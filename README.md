My First Python Project ( this is a Kaggle Competition)

ML and DL
Training the data with different models

1. xgboost
  - adtracking.py (with train_sample)
  - chunk_test.py (full data version): 
      dividing the full train dataset into 10 chunks
      using loop for the model training
      predict with full test dataset
